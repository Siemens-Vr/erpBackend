Getting Started with the Application
To set up and run the application locally, follow the steps below.

1. Download or Clone the Repository
First, you need to obtain the source code for the application. You can either download it as a ZIP file or clone the repository using Git.

Option 1: Download as ZIP
Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
Click on the green "Code" button.
Select "Download ZIP" from the dropdown menu.
Extract the ZIP file to your desired location on your local machine.

Option 2: Clone the Repository Using Git
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command to clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

Navigate into the project directory:
cd repository-name

2. Install the Required Dependencies
Before running the application, you need to install the necessary dependencies. The project uses Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).

Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from the official website.
In your terminal, navigate to the root directory of the project (where the package.json file is located).
Run the following command to install all dependencies:
npm install
This command reads the package.json file and installs all required packages listed under dependencies.

3. Configure Environment Variables
The application requires certain environment variables to function correctly. These variables are stored in an .env file. You need to create this file from the provided .env.example file and populate it with the appropriate values.

In the project directory, locate the .env.example file.
Create a copy of this file and rename it to .env.
Open the newly created .env file in a text editor.
Populate the file with the required values for each environment variable. These values might include  database connection strings, and other configuration settings specific to your environment.

4. Start the Application
Once the dependencies are installed and the environment variables are configured, you can start the application.

Run the following command in your terminal:
npm start
This command will start the application. If everything is set up correctly, the application should be running on your local machine.


5. Access the Application
After starting the application, it should be accessible via your web browser. The specific URL and port will depend on how your application is configured (often http://localhost:{port} by default).
